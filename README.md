# Storage-as-a-Service

## Concept: Storage as a Service
## Project Topic: Combining multiple cloud storage accounts into one 

We all have accounts in multiple cloud storage providers like Google Drive, One Drive, Dropbox etc., The purpose of this web service is to combine all the different cloud storage accounts into a single unified account, thereby providing a single interface for organizing files, and adding more storage capacity on the cloud without having to obtain the same from a single provider which can be expensive. Also this will give us the flexibility to move files across cloud accounts, or replicate it across them in case there is a need. 

Following features were implemented
1. A single web interface to manage Google Drive, Dropbox
2. Upload, Download and Search files from a single place
